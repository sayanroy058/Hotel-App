# Telegram Integration Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Data Persistence Problem
**Problem**: Form fields were showing incorrect data after save/reload due to wrong column indexing in templates.

**Solution**: 
- Updated database queries to use explicit column selection instead of `SELECT *`
- Fixed template column indices to match the actual database schema
- The `telegram_chat_id` column was added later and was at index 12, not 7

### 2. Telegram Chat ID Configuration
**Problem**: Even when chat ID was added, the system wasn't recognizing it properly.

**Solution**:
- Fixed column mapping in `edit_hotel.html` template (changed `hotel[7]` to `hotel[12]` for chat ID)
- Updated all hotel-related routes to use proper column ordering
- Added proper validation and display of chat ID status

### 3. Telegram Bot Integration
**Problem**: Bot wasn't sending notifications and connection testing wasn't available.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `send_notification()` function with better error handling
- Added support for hotel-specific bot tokens
- Created test connection functionality for administrators
- Added booking notification system

## New Features Added

### 1. Test Telegram Connection
- Administrators can now test Telegram connections from the hotel view page
- Test messages are sent to verify the bot is working properly

### 2. Booking Notifications
- Automatic Telegram notifications are sent when new bookings are created
- Notifications include guest details, room info, and booking amounts

### 3. Setup Guide
- Created comprehensive Telegram setup guide at `/telegram-setup`
- Step-by-step instructions for users to get their chat ID
- Troubleshooting section for common issues

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- Better logging for Telegram operations
- Graceful fallback when Telegram is not configured
- Clear error messages for configuration issues

## How to Use

### For Administrators:

1. **Edit Hotel**: Go to Admin → Hotels → Edit Hotel
2. **Configure Telegram**: 
   - Enter the hotel's Telegram number
   - Use the provided bot token or enter a custom one
   - Get the chat ID from the hotel owner (see setup guide)
3. **Test Connection**: Use the "Test Connection" button in hotel view to verify setup

### For Hotel Owners:

1. **Get Chat ID**: 
   - Visit `/telegram-setup` for detailed instructions
   - Start the bot in Telegram by sending `/start`
   - Copy the chat ID provided by the bot
   - Give this ID to your administrator

2. **Receive Notifications**:
   - New booking alerts
   - Check-in/check-out notifications
   - System updates

## Technical Details

```

### Column Order (for templates):
```

```

## Files Modified
